                <span><!-- line here --></span>
                <p>Last year, I failed my driving test. After researching, I discovered that 75% of UK 
                    driving tests result in failure. Additionally, road accidents are currently at an 
                    all-time high due to human faults such as drunk driving, speeding, and poor reaction 
                    time. This made me realize that the traditional concept of human driving is flawed. 
                    Unlike humans, computers are not subject to these limitations, which is why I believe 
                    that autonomous cars are the future. However, there is skepticism and stigma 
                    surrounding this technology. To help people understand how self-driving technology 
                    works without any influence from biased media, I designed the CAR-ACT simulation. 
                    This simulation incorporates neural and deep learning used by many autonomous cars 
                    and sensor detection to replicate the behavior of modern self-driving cars.
