![Self-Driving Car](images/self_driving_car.png)

Welcome to the CAR-ACT repository! This project aims to create a realistic simulation environment for training and testing self-driving cars to understand their backend algorithms better.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive self-driving car simulation environment that allows enthusiasts to:

- Train and test self-driving car model.
- Experiment with different sensors, mutation amounts, and road conditions.
- Learn about the core technologies behind autonomous vehicles.

## Features

- **Realistic 2D Simulation**: The simulation environment includes realistic 2D graphics and physics modeling for an immersive experience.

- **Sensor**: A sensor is provided to replicate real-world sensor data.

- **Control Interfaces**: You can implement various elements of the algorithms, such as mutation amount or road conditions.

- **Scenario Testing**: Create and run complex driving scenarios to evaluate your self-driving algorithms under different conditions.

- **Login System**: Easily store data from the simulation for use later.

- **Leaderboard**: Compete with friends to see who is the master of self-driving cars

## Getting Started

To get started with this self-driving car simulation, follow these steps:
